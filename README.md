# Flagging Website

This is the code base for the Charles River Watershed Association's flagging website.

This code base is built in Python and utilizes the Flask library heavily.

## Setup

For now, the website is not containerized or anything like that. We are running it from the command line.

I _strongly_ recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to set up this project as you develop it. Click the plus sign `+` in the "Terminal" window, and in your new terminal do the following: 

**On Windows:** open up the command prompt, and in the project directory enter:

```commandline
run_windows
```

**On OSX or Linux:** open up bash, and in the project directory enter:

```bash
sh run_unix.sh
```

To test that your website is working, go to the localhost and make sure it's working.
